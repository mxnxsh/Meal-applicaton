React Navigation & Code Attachments
You don't have to read this lecture - it's only relevant if you plan on running one of my code attachments!

Throughout the course, you find code attachments which you can use to compare your code to mine.

In case you want to run my attachments, make sure you follow these steps to use react-navigation v4 in them:

1) Run npm install and then expo upgrade

2) Install all extra navigators that are required for this specific code snapshot:

npm install --save react-navigation-stack

npm install --save react-navigation-tabs

npm install --save react-navigation-drawer

(of course you can combine that all into one npm install command if you need all of them)

3) Make sure you're using version 4 of react-navigation

npm install --save react-navigation@latest

4) Install all required dependencies

expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view

5) Update all "navigator" imports

import { createStackNavigator, createAppContainer } from 'react-navigation';

would become

import { createAppContainer } from 'react-navigation';
import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';
for example. Do that for all navigators (e.g. tabs, drawer) you might be using in the specific snapshot.

And with that, the attachments should work.

I basically show all of that throughout the lectures - I'm just summing it up here so that you have a quick & easy go-to reference.
